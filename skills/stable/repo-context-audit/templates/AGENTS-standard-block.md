## Documentation

Indexed in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). Every page is self-contained — it
assumes you opened that one file and have nothing else loaded.

| where | what | read it |
|---|---|---|
| [architecture/](docs/architecture/) | where behaviour lives, one page per area | before going looking for something |
| [traps/](docs/traps/) | failure modes with no error message, indexed by symptom | before debugging something wrong but not crashing |
| [reference/](docs/reference/) | simply true, expensive to re-derive | when you need the detail |
| [adr/](docs/adr/) | why the repo is the way it is | before changing something that looks odd |

## Before you wrap up

Leave the repo holding what this session cost you to find out. Four rules.

1. **Sort it, and expect most of it to go nowhere.** A next action is an issue. A
   durable, expensive-to-re-derive fact is a page. A choice that was hard to
   reverse, surprising without context and a real trade-off is a decision record
   under `docs/adr/`. Status, dates, version pins and plans are none of those —
   delete them.
2. **A doc is the last resort.** Type error → test → comment at the site → doc.
   Name the single line you would have commented instead; if you can name it,
   comment it and stop.
3. **Verify against running code before writing, and date the page `verified:`.**
   Anything remembered from earlier in the session is stale until re-read. Deleting
   a draft because the problem is already fixed is a success.
4. **Append, never rewrite.** Supersede a merged decision record with a new one
   naming what it replaces. A trap filename is an identifier quoted elsewhere:
   edit the body, never the name.

Then run `<the repo's index generator>`. Never hand-maintain an index.
